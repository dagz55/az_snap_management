 # Module 1: Develop Playbooks with Ansible Automation Platform 2

 ## Definition
 Ansible playbooks are YAML files that describe a set of tasks to be executed on remote hosts. They are the building blocks for complex IT automation workflows in Ansible Automation
 Platform 2.

 ## Example Playbook
 ```yaml
 ---
 - name: Install and configure web server
   hosts: webservers
   become: yes
   vars:
     http_port: 80
     max_clients: 200

   tasks:
     - name: Install Apache
       yum:
         name: httpd
         state: present

     - name: Configure Apache
       template:
         src: httpd.conf.j2
         dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
       notify: Restart Apache

     - name: Start Apache service
       service:
         name: httpd
         state: started
         enabled: yes

   handlers:
     - name: Restart Apache
       service:
         name: httpd
         state: restarted



                                                                                       Use Case

Automating the deployment and configuration of a web server across multiple hosts in a consistent and repeatable manner.


                                                                                    Troubleshooting

 1 Syntax errors: Use ansible-playbook --syntax-check playbook.yml
 2 Verbose output: Run playbooks with -v, -vv, or -vvv for increasing verbosity
 3 Check mode: Use --check to perform a dry run without making changes
 4 Task-specific debugging: Use the debug module to print variable values


                                                                  Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up Your First Playbook

 1 Install Ansible Automation Platform 2
 2 Create a new directory for your project
 3 Initialize a new playbook file (e.g., webserver_setup.yml)
 4 Define the play and hosts
 5 Add tasks for installation and configuration
 6 Include variables and handlers
 7 Run the playbook using ansible-playbook webserver_setup.yml


                                                                              Recommended Configurations

 1 Use ansible.cfg for default configurations
 2 Organize playbooks into roles for better structure
 3 Utilize variables for environment-specific settings
 4 Implement proper indentation (2 spaces) for readability


                                                                                      Cheat Sheet


 # Basic playbook structure
 ---
 - name: Play name
   hosts: target_hosts
   tasks:
     - name: Task 1
       module_name:
         key1: value1
         key2: value2

 # Common modules
 yum/apt: Package management
 service: Manage services
 copy: Copy files
 template: Use Jinja2 templates
 file: Manage files and directories
 user: Manage user accounts

 # Running playbooks
 ansible-playbook playbook.yml
 ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
 ansible-playbook --limit host1 playbook.yml

 # Playbook best practices
 - Use meaningful names for plays and tasks
 - Keep playbooks idempotent
 - Use roles for reusable content
 - Leverage variables and facts
 - Implement proper error handling



                                                                                   Hands-on Exercise

Develop a playbook that:

 1 Installs a web server (Apache or Nginx)
 2 Configures the server with a custom configuration file
 3 Deploys a simple HTML page
 4 Ensures the service is running and enabled
 5 Implements a handler to restart the service when the configuration changes

This exercise will reinforce the concepts of tasks, handlers, variables, and templating in Ansible playbooks.

# Module 2: Manage Content Collections and Execution Environments

## Definition
Ansible Content Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins. Execution Environments are containerized images that include Ansible Core, dependencies, and content collections, providing a consistent and portable automation environment.

## Example Content Collection Structure
```
collection/
├── docs/
├── galaxy.yml
├── plugins/
│   ├── modules/
│   ├── inventory/
│   └── ...
├── README.md
├── roles/
└── playbooks/
```

## Use Cases
1. Standardizing automation content across an organization
2. Sharing reusable Ansible content within teams or the community
3. Ensuring consistent execution environments across different systems
4. Simplifying dependency management for complex automation projects

## Troubleshooting
1. Collection not found: Verify the collection is installed and the path is correct
2. Execution Environment issues: Check container logs and ensure all dependencies are included
3. Version conflicts: Use `ansible-galaxy collection list` to check installed versions

## Step-by-Step Guide: Working with Collections and Execution Environments
1. Install a collection: `ansible-galaxy collection install namespace.collection`
2. Use a collection in a playbook:
   ```yaml
   - hosts: all
     collections:
       - namespace.collection
     tasks:
       - namespace.collection.module_name:
           key: value
   ```
3. Create an Execution Environment definition file (execution-environment.yml)
4. Build the Execution Environment: `ansible-builder build -f execution-environment.yml`
5. Use the Execution Environment with ansible-navigator

## Recommended Configurations
1. Use `requirements.yml` to specify collection dependencies
2. Implement version pinning for collections and Execution Environments
3. Utilize private Automation Hub for organization-specific collections
4. Implement CI/CD pipelines for testing and publishing collections

## Cheat Sheet
```
# Collection management
ansible-galaxy collection install namespace.collection
ansible-galaxy collection list
ansible-galaxy collection build

# Execution Environment
ansible-builder build -f execution-environment.yml
ansible-navigator run playbook.yml -e execution_environment_image=my-ee:latest

# Collection usage in playbooks
collections:
  - namespace.collection

# Using fully qualified collection names
- namespace.collection.module_name:
    key: value

# Execution Environment definition
---
version: 1
dependencies:
  galaxy: requirements.yml
  python: requirements.txt
additional_build_steps:
  prepend: |
    RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools
  append:
    - RUN echo "Additional steps here"
```

## Hands-on Exercise
1. Create a simple custom collection with a module and a role
2. Publish the collection to a local Ansible Galaxy server
3. Create an Execution Environment that includes your custom collection
4. Write a playbook that uses content from your collection
5. Run the playbook using the custom Execution Environment

This exercise will give participants hands-on experience with creating, managing, and using both content collections and execution environments in Ansible Automation Platform 2.

# Module 4: Work with Ansible Configuration Settings

## Definition
Ansible configuration settings control various aspects of Ansible's behavior, including default options, connection settings, and plugin paths. These settings can be specified in multiple locations, with a defined precedence order.

## Configuration File Locations (in order of precedence)
1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable
2. ./ansible.cfg (current directory)
3. ~/.ansible.cfg (home directory)
4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

## Key Configuration Sections
1. [defaults]: General default settings
2. [privilege_escalation]: Settings for become functionality
3. [connection]: Connection-specific settings
4. [galaxy]: Ansible Galaxy settings
5. [inventory]: Inventory-related settings

## Use Cases
1. Customizing default behaviors for specific projects
2. Setting organization-wide standards
3. Optimizing performance for large-scale deployments
4. Configuring plugin and module paths

## Troubleshooting
1. Unexpected behavior: Check which config file is being used with `ansible --version`
2. Permission issues: Ensure config files have correct permissions
3. Syntax errors: Validate config file syntax
4. Precedence conflicts: Be aware of the precedence order of config sources

## Step-by-Step Guide: Creating and Using a Custom Configuration
1. Create a new file named `ansible.cfg` in your project directory
2. Add the [defaults] section header
3. Set desired configuration options (e.g., inventory, remote_user)
4. Save the file and run ansible commands from that directory
5. Verify the config is being used with `ansible --version`

## Recommended Configurations
1. Set a consistent `remote_user` for your environment
2. Configure appropriate `become` settings for privilege escalation
3. Set `host_key_checking = False` for testing environments
4. Adjust `forks` for performance tuning
5. Configure `roles_path` for custom role locations

## Cheat Sheet
```ini
# Common configuration options

[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = ansible
host_key_checking = False
forks = 20
roles_path = ./roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles
log_path = ./ansible.log
nocows = 1

[privilege_escalation]
become = True
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = False

[connection]
pipelining = True

[galaxy]
server_list = public_galaxy, my_galaxy

[inventory]
enable_plugins = host_list, script, auto, yaml, ini, toml
```

## Hands-on Exercise
1. Create a custom `ansible.cfg` file with specific settings for a project
2. Configure multiple inventory sources
3. Set up custom paths for roles and collections
4. Configure and test different connection settings
5. Implement and test privilege escalation configurations
6. Use environment variables to temporarily override config settings
7. Create a script to dynamically generate an ansible.cfg based on the execution environment

This exercise will give participants hands-on experience with creating, modifying, and troubleshooting Ansible configuration files, as well as understanding the impact of different settings on Ansible's behavior.
